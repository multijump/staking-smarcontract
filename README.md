# David Contracts
Hi David,

Inside the folder `contracts_original` are a series of contracts provided to us from a team working on another projects.

Inside the folder `contracts_deployed` are the same contracts slightly modified, but deployed on Rinkeby testnet.

What we require from you is:

1. Confirm code is functioning as intended
2. Full test the entire flow of the code
3. Provide a simple working web3 front-end so that we can also test the contracts on testnet
4. Audit the security of the code

## Overview
We would like to create two tokens, one primary ERC-20 token `$SWORD` and another non-tradable token `$SHARD`.

We would like to create two staking pool that receives two different tokens:

	1. $SWORD / ETH Uniswap V2 LP tokens
	2. $SWORD tokens

Each token will reward a specific % rate of `$SHARD` over time.

The user should be able to unstake and received their deposit and their `$SHARD` reward.

The user will be able to view and redeem NFTs for `$SHARD` token on OpenSea.
